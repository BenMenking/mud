# Description
Multi-User Domain built in PHP - "because we can"

# Purpose
Actually, it's a fun little project that my son and I are working on.  He'll get experience and I'll get to relive the younger days.  Since he's starting out in programming and I've had over 20 years of development and architecting, the plan is to use PHP as natively as possible.  This will also be experience using a source code repository system.
